# This is not my srs bznz account

tl;dr: [click here for srs bznz](https://yoshirulz.github.io); tell the world I'm a furry, but don't mention anything yiffy or my üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà flamboyant homosexuality ‚ö£. kthxbai.

Because some of my projects are... NSFW, to say the least, I use this account ([@SuscipiamSingularitatem](https://github.com/SuscipiamSingularitatem)) for them, keeping my *actual* account ([@YoshiRulz](https://github.com/YoshiRulz), [github.io](https://yoshirulz.github.io)) future-employer-friendly. Unless, of course, my future employer happens to be Dragonfru.it (plz hire me, o yiffy overlords).

Back to the point, I'd really appreciate it if the two accounts were kept seperate. Not that I'm trying to keep my furry-ness a secret from anybody (though I am most definitely closeted), I just don't want the "less acceptable" parts of being furry associated with myself professionally. I'm sure you, having found yourself on this page, will understand.

On my proper github.io ([clicky clicky](https://yoshirulz.github.io)), there's a list of my non-sexual projects. All the projects I work on under this account are in the GH organisation [@CyberYiff](https://github.com/CyberYiff), which I formed with a couple of like-minded furs. I won't list them here, you can scroll through the list easily enough.

If you've read down to here, there's not much I can say except thank you, I suppose, for being a part of what will surely be the greatest revolution in ~~furry~~ human history (I, for one, can't wait to see genetically-enhanced humans with bioluminescent penises).

Finally, if you were wondering, this account's name is Latin for "*[I] await the singularity*", though it's not a perfect translation of "singularity". If you know Latin (there's always one), please feel free to [fork and PR](https://github.com/SuscipiamSingularitatem/SuscipiamSingularitatem.github.io/pulls), commenting on my poor grasp of the fundamentals of Latin grammar.
